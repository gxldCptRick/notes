        <h3>How To Query with Spring</h3>
        <p>
          So last time I am pretty sure I forgot to make something about
          querying into spring so since we have fully covered it I will go over
          it now. In Spring to query we actually have a really cool thing called
          <em>AUTO GENERATED QUERIES</em>. these
          <em>AUTO GENERATED QUERIES</em> allow us to construct an english
          sentence to build out sql queries to get a specific action from the
          database. We make <em>AUTO GENERATED QUERIES</em> by adding them as
          methods on the Repository that we want to work with. All
          <em>AUTO GENERATED QUERIES</em> start with findBy which tells spring
          "Hey I need you to make a query for me". Then we have to specify what
          we want to match on. The simplest query we can make is to just target
          a single field. For example with our exercise we can query on the name
          of it by just telling it findByName and then bam you will now have a
          method that will find a exercise by the name.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-class">List</span>&lt;<span class="code-class">Exercise</span>&gt; <span class="code-identifier">findByName</span>(<span class="code-class">String</span> <span class="code-identifier">name</span>);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can make a more complex query with logical operators such as
          <em>And</em> we can also look for stuff in collections too with
          <em>Contains</em>. There is so many cool things we can even take it as
          far as setting up a fuzzy search with the like operator.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-class">List</span>&lt;<span class="code-class">Exercise</span>&gt; <span class="code-identifier">findByNameLikeAndSetsContains</span>(<span class="code-class">String</span> <span class="code-identifier">name</span>, <span class="code-class">Set</span> <span class="code-identifier">set</span>);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Sometimes we need more fine tuned control over the way we query the
          database. So we use the <span class="code-annotation">@Query</span> to
          specify the <em>JPQL</em>. It is an important distinction because we
          are querying on objects not tables in the database so make sure that
          you use field names not column names. When we need to add a variable
          to <em>JPQL</em> we use named parameters. the relative look of them
          are just ":identifer" so that means in our example we will make one
          called name. in order for us to fill in that query we will need to
          pass in a parameter to the query to fill it out. We mark that
          parameter with the <span class="code-annotation">@Param</span> and
          then pass it in the string name of the identifier that you used.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
<span class="code-annotation">@Query</span>(<span class="code-string">"SELECT e "</span>+
        <span class="code-string">"FROM Exercise e "</span> +
        <span class="code-string">"WHERE e.name LIKE :name"</span>)
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-class">List</span>&lt;<span class="code-class">Exercise</span>&gt; <span class="code-identifier">queryByNameLike</span>(
    <span class="code-annotation">@Param</span>(<span class="code-string">"name"</span>) <span class="code-class">String</span> <span class="code-identifier">name</span>);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Other times we need to go even further beyond and in fact write raw
          sql queries to get a very specific query if the database is really
          rank. In order to do this we will reuse that same annotation
          <span class="code-annotation">@Query</span> but we will have to add a
          couple more things to make this work. We will need to give it a value
          and set that equal to the actual query we want to make. Then we will
          have to mark it as a <em>nativeQuery</em> by setting that to
          <em>true</em>. That is all you need in order to make a very specific
          query in sql.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
<span class="code-annotation">@Query</span>(
    <span class="code-attribute">value</span>=<span class="code-string">"SELECT * FROM exercise e WHERE e.name like '%blah%'"</span>, 
    <span class="code-attribute">nativeQuery</span>=<span class="code-special">true</span>)
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-class">List</span>&lt;<span class="code-class">Exercise</span>&gt; <span class="code-identifier">queryBySuperComplexNative</span>();
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          There is way more than I can teach you about this so you should
          totally google:
          <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=Spring+automated+queries"
            >Spring Automated Queries</a
          >
          Just so you can see the power of the automated queries in Spring.

        <p>
          Other than the query stuff we didn't really cover anything else today.
          It was a work today and Mr. Cox said that we should expect workdays
          for the rest of the week so hopefully that will be able to ease your
          mind.
