        <h3>Maven Web App Archetype</h3>
        <p>
          So we learned about a new archetype that we can use to create a Web
          App and have it just work with maven. The thing is that it doesn't
          include some pretty important stuff and so we would have to do some
          setup so that we can quickly get up and running with it.

          />
          <p>
            Click on the next button so that you can select a maven archetype
          </p>
        </div>

            alt="Selecting the Web App Template"
          />
          <p>Then search for maven-archetype-webapp and select the archetype</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img

            alt="Fill out maven project template"
          />
          <p>
            Fill out the info for your maven project and blam you then have to
            actually fix the project it created
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img

            alt="Selecting the configure properties"
          />
          <p>
            Right click on the project you just created and then go to
            properties
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img

            alt="Going into project facets and click on runtimes"
          />
          <p>Go to the project facets and then go into the runtime tabs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/yi2H70x.png"
            alt="Clicking on the runtime we want"
          />
          <p>
            Click on the runtime that we want and it should fix the first
            problem we have.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/fE74D1x.png"
            alt="adding the java folder"
          />
          <p>
            Now we have to create the folder for our sources so we will create a
            java folder inside the main folder.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          After all the steps you will have finally created a full maven powered
          web project.
