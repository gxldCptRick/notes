          So it has come to my attention that I have totally forgotten to do
          something about yesterday mostly how to convert a dynamic web project
          (The jsp project we made) into a maven project.
        </p>

        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/cUvPpap.png"
            alt="clicking on the project and going to convert to maven"
          />
          <caption>
            First we right click on the project we want to convert. Head down to
            will see configure and then go and click the convert to maven
            project
          </caption>
        </div>

        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/FGSbFiH.png"
            alt="filling in the maven project info."
          />
          <caption>
            Then you fill out the information that you need for the maven
            project such as the group id and the artifact id etc...
          </caption>
        </div>

        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/6V1K2Cp.png"
            alt="now we wait for eclipse to be awesome..."
          />
          <caption>
            Then all you have to do is wait for it to finish. The loading bar is
            on the bottom right and be very careful because if you do anything
            to eclipse while it is working it could potentially lock up and
            brick your project
          </caption>
        </div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/FmTOUOy.png"
            alt="finished now we can do stuff to the maven pom file!!"
          />
          <caption>
            After it is done it should open up the pom file that got created and
            you can now do pom stuff.
