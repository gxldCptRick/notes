        <h2>Deploying To Tomcat</h2>
        <p>
          To deploy to Tomcat it is really really easy all you just have to
          follow a couple of steps
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#build"> Build Project</a></li>
          <li><a href="#package">Package the Project with Maven</a></li>
          <li><a href="#tomcat">Publish on Tomcat</a></li>
        </ol>
        <div id="build">
          <h3>Build Project</h3>
          <p>
            Just like you would always just make sure you build the project so
            that you can be sure that the code will run on the server
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="package">
          <h3>Package with Maven</h3>
          <p>
            After your successful build you will then have Two ways to package
            the project. You will either use the maven command line or you can
            right click on the project and go to run as and run it as a maven
            build. If you decide the right click method you will have to just
            tell maven what goals to run for this build. Both of the ways will
            have the same Goals. You will specify <code>clean install</code> in
            that exact spelling and casing. If you decide to run with the
            command line you will have to open the command line to the directory
            that contains your pom file and run "<code>mvn clean install</code>"
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tomcat">
          <h3>Deploying to tomcat</h3>
          <p>
            So in order to deploy to tomcat you will have to know exactly where
            on disk tomcat is installed. You will have to navigate to its folder
            and find the webapps folder. After you find it you will have to go
            back to your project and look for the target folder. In the target
            folder you should have a war file if not then just go back a step
            and run those commands. Then copy the war file into the webapps
            folder of your tomcat installation. After that it should work
            magically. To access the application you will need to go to
            https://localhost:8080/&lt;name of war file&gt;/&lt;actual servlet
            path&gt;
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="disclaimer">
          <h3>Be Careful</h3>
          <p>
            May not be able to have the app run the first time. If you have
            issues it will probably with the database connections. To make the
            smoothest possible deploy make sure that the server that you are
            running and installing tomcat on is also running the database as
            well. If not make sure that you can give network access for the
            tomcat server to access the database server. If you are having
            problems running the application you can also check the logs of the
            tomcat instance. The log files are located on the install in the
            logs folder. The log files that you should care about are called
            STDOUT for standard output, STDERR for the errors, Catalina which is
            another file that is where most of the servers are outputting into.
            In linux you will only ever need to go into the Catalina file but
            for windows you will need to go to all three.
