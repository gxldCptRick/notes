        <h3>More About Pushdown Automata Notation</h3>
        <p>
          We began again on a real quick refresher on push down automata. We
          focused primarily on how they are different from the finite state
          machine. The main difference as you may now is just the stack. Because
          we have a stack and the stack has a theoretically infinite amount of
          memory it cannot be finite.

        <p>
          As you know last time we worked on example diagrams but Mr. Krebs
          didn't like the diagram in the book so he found some for the same
          Language but using a different alphabet. It looks really rank to me so
          I don't know how to properly explain it so sorry.

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          He then showed us this diagram and honestly I like it a lot more than
          the other two. Basically you have the symbol before the Fat Arrow and
          that is the symbol that you are reading. the Fat Arrow shows you what
          function you will do. I think it is way easier to read.

          Basically the rest of todays were dedicated for pass-offs and what
          have you.
