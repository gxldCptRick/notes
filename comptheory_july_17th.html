        <h3>Non Deterministic Quiz</h3>
        <p>
          So we took a quiz to try to wrap up the chapter 5 reading assignment.
          I am not gonna lie it was actually a really cool reading machine. I
          don't want to spoil it for you because you are going to take it but
          just know it is the most needlessly complicated machine I have ever
          seen.

        <h3>Non Deterministic Practice</h3>
        <p>
          We worked on practicing more ndm's or whatever you want to call them.
          The machine we did was a machine that had an alphabet alright of
          &#8721; { 0 , 1} and it had to meet one or both of these conditions.
          It had to be an odd amount of zeros or a non multiple of 3 amount of
          1s or both.

          Me, Damon, and Fermin worked together to try to figure it out and we

        <h3>Steps to Convert a Non Deterministic to Deterministic</h3>
        <p>
          We walked through converting a simple Non Deterministic Machine into a
          Deterministic Machine. The machine we worked on was basically working
          on the regex
        </p>
        <div class="code">(01)* + (010)*</div>
        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/DXUQYx5.png"
            alt="the non deterministic machine we are working on."
          />
          <p>
            The machine that is described by that regex
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We start the process by looking that the starting state and then
          looking at the alphabet and just going through each of the symbols and
          then build out the connections to the states however if a symbol leads
          to multiple states then you combine those states into a new mega state
          that uses all three of them.
        </p>
        <div class="frame">
          <img

            alt="The next step with the initial states and then building out the routes from it."

            The example image that he showed us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Since we have processed all the symbols for the initial state we move
          to the mega state and start looking at the diagram again. We then see
          that both states of B and C fail when they take in 0 so that means
          that we can just go to the fail trap state on 0. Then we go to the
          next symbol of 1 and then ask the question what does B go to and we
          see that it goes to A then we ask the question what does C go to on 1
          and then we see that it goes to D. We combine those states again to
          make a mega state. The thing is that since this state contains at
          least one accept state the entire thing becomes an accept state.
        </p>

          />
          <p>
            The next diagram that he showed us to help us understand the
            connections.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We then go on to the AD state and then rinse and repeat this process
          again. We look at what A goes to when it is zero and we see it goes to
          both B and C. Then we look at what D goes to when given 0 and we see
          that it goes to A. We then create a mega state consisting of ABC and
          have an arrow for 0. We then ask again like last time where does a go
          given 1 and see that it fails on that input. Then we ask again for D
          and it fails on 1 that means we can just lead to the fail state. After
          that we go to the Mega ABC state and then just like last time we go
          back and forth with one symbol going through each mini state in the
          mega state we then see that it goes back to the BC fail because those
          both fail on zero and Goes back to the AD state on 1 because both BC
          go to AD respectively
