        <h3>Spring Configurations</h3>
        <p>
          So Today Mr. Cox was started off with a quick refresher about what
          each of the things we needed to do in order to fix up the application
          and have it fully run. We started with just double check the
          application.properties. So before we could actually do anything useful
          we went and finished up relating the two entities that we had
          together. We added a List&lt;Set&gt; to the Exercise and made sure to
          add an Exercise to the Set. With these two things we could start
          building out the stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the first thing we had to actually change was to add a new
          annotation to the parameters of the method we call for the post. We
          will use the <span class="code-annotation">@RequestBody</span> to tell
          spring boot to create the object from the values in the body.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
<span class="code-annotation">@RequestMapping</span>(<span class="code-string">path</span>=<span class="code-string">""</span>, <span class="code-attribute">method</span>=<span class="code-class">RequestMethod</span>.POST)
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-class">Integer</span> <span class="code-identifier">createExercise</span>(<span class="code-attribute">@RequestBody</span> <span class="code-class">Exercise</span> <span class="code-identifier">exercise</span>) {
  <span class="code-identifier">exerciseJpaRepository</span>.saveAndFlush(<span class="code-identifier">exercise</span>);
  <span class="code-keyword">return</span> <span class="code-identifier">exercise</span>.getId();
}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          So this would be how we changed the createExercise method to be able
          to properly accept the objects being posted to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this little bit of configuration we will need to update the our
          main method with a few more annotations. We will need to add the
          <span class="code-annotation">@ComponentScan</span> so that we can
          have spring boot scan our package for "beans" or objects that we have
          defined as needing a dependency. Basically it figures out what stuff
          is auto-wired or is being used in someway and then creates it then and
          there. We will also need to add the
          <span class="code-annotation">@EnableAutoConfiguration</span> so that
          we can have it give default values for the values.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
<span class="code-keyword">import</span> org.springframework.boot.<span class="code-class">SpringApplication</span>;
<span class="code-keyword">import</span> org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.<span class="code-class">EnableAutoConfiguration</span>;
<span class="code-keyword">import</span> org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.<span class="code-class">SpringBootApplication</span>;
<span class="code-keyword">import</span> org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.<span class="code-class">SpringBootServletInitializer</span>;
<span class="code-keyword">import</span> org.springframework.context.annotation.<span class="code-class">ComponentScan</span>;

<span class="code-annotation">@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfiguration</span>
<span class="code-keyword">public class</span> <span class="code-class">ExerciseLogApplication</span> <span class="code-keyword">extends</span> <span class="code-class">SpringBootServletInitializer</span> {
    <span class="code-keyword">public static void</span> <span class="code-identifier">main</span>(<span class="code-class">String</span>[] <span class="code-identifier">args</span>) {
        <span class="code-class">SpringApplication</span>.run(<span class="code-class">ExerciseLogApplication</span>.<span class="code-keyword">class</span>, <span class="code-identifier">args</span>);
    }
}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          After setting those up you should be able to run your application.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="run-baby-run">
        <h3>Running a Spring Application</h3>
        <p>
          So for running the application all you have to do is just run it just
          like any other java app. Under the hood Spring Boot is creating and
          spinning up a tomcat server that will serve all the servlets. Give it
          time and if it just prints out simple stuff in the console then
          everything was hooked up correctly and hurray it works if not then you
          will need to do some debugging
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common problems that you will face if any will probably be
          sql related so just make sure you line up the properties again if it
          is the driver. If it is something to deal with the configurations like
          something like it can't find something double check that you have
          marked all the controllers correctly. We actually had a simple bug
          today because he used set and apparently that is a reserved word in
          MariaDB
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="testing-app">
        <h3>Testing the Routes</h3>
        <p>
          To test the application and make sure everything is working fine you
          should use postman to make the requests. An easy way to test the
          Exercise Controller is to post directly to that route.
        </p>
        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/AFiaB5M.png"
            alt="Postman to post to a route"
          />
          <p>This is how you would make a specific kind of request</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          After going to the post for postman you will then need to go into the
          body and set it equal to raw text. After that you can set it up so
          that you can have the text be read as json so do that so the server
          understands what it is. After that fill out the information that you
          will need to make an exercise. Don't worry about creating a set right
          now because for restful services we want to make things as small and
          as quick as possible. Because we want to do this we only focus on the
          smallest amount of work that can be done safely in this case it would
          be creating a exercise with a name.
        </p>
        <div class="frame">
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/kMfpH2X.png"
            alt="Filled out form of posting to the route"
          />
          <p>
            Filled out form of posting to the route.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          After all of this just hit the route and then blam if we get a 200
          then we did everything right if not then we will have to go around
          doing figuring out what went wrong on the server side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes posting to a route raw is useful and honestly the majority
          of the work will be fine to be designed that way. However there will
          be a time in which just posting to a route blindly will not work
          because of the relationship of the data such as creating a Set. So we
          will use paths variables. In order to use path variables we will need
          to define them in the path attribute inside the
          <span class="code-annotation">@RequestMapping</span> attribute to
          reflect it. For this we are going to modify the string for the post of
          the SetController. This is the route we will use the route instead.
          <span class="code-string">"/exercise/{exerciseId}"</span> the square
          brackets are what we use to define the variable and we will have to
          match the variable name in the path with on in our method so we will
          need to add a variable to take in this parameter. To do this correctly
          we will use the
          <span class="code-attribute">@PathVariable</span> attribute to mark
          the parameter as something that we will get from the route. This is
          all you need to do to have your own custom path variables
