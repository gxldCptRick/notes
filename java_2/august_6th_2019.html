        <h3>CRUD For REST</h3>
        <p>Create is done with the POST</p>
        <p>Read is done with GET</p>
        <p>Update is down with both PUT and PATCH</p>
        <p>Delete is down with DELETE</p>
        <p>
          We focused on The first two last time and so this time we began our
          work on updating and deleting from specifically Exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start our work we had to fix an issue that came up last time. When
          we got the exercises from the server they had sets and as you may
          hopefully remember we added the exercise as a property for our set.
          but hey exercises uses sets and hey sets have exercises and I hope you
          can see where I am going with this. Long story short we have to decide
          the way we want to access the relationship. Mr. Cox decided that we
          should ignore the property on the set object. To ignore a property in
          the serialization since we are using jackson all we have to do is use
          the jackson property of
          <span class="code-annotation">@JsonIgnore</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After fixing this issue we began working towards updating the exercise
          controller to delete and update exercises. To make it delete we have
          to decide what it has to do. We decide in order to delete an entity
          all we need is the id. So we use the path to hold a variable for the
          id. so our method signature will look a little something like this.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
<span class="code-annotation">@RequestPath</span>(<span class="code-attribute">path</span>=<span class="code-string">"/{id}"</span>,<span class="code-attribute">method</span>=<span class="code-class">HttpRequest</span>.DELETE)
<span class="code-keyword">public void</span> deleteExercise(<span class="code-annotation">@PathVariable</span> <span class="code-primitive">int</span> <span class="code-identifier">id</span>){
    <span class="code-comment">//etc...</span> 
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We mark up the path the way we want to use it. We make sure to line up
          the name of the path variable with a parameter. Lastly we just fill in
          the method the way we need too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Updating will be a little more difficult. So there will be to versions
          of updating. The first way we approached it was the totally update. In
          order to totally update the record we will be needing an id and an
          object that will replace it. So what is gonna happen is we use the id
          to fetch the record from the database. Then after fetching we will
          merge both the records together. Mr. Cox suggest that since we are
          accessing the fields we should leave the responsibility of the merge
          into the the class that you are merging. i.e. if i'm trying to merge
          an exercise I will have the code in exercise. For total updates it is
          recommended that you use the HTTP PUT method.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other way we can update is if only have parts that we update. In
          order to do this effectively we will need an id and we will also need
          a map of string and object. The reason why we have a map of string and
          object is because we want to represent all javascript object. Then,
          like last time, fetch the existing record and then for each over each
          of the key value pairs and fill in the matching fields. Mr. Cox
          suggested that we do a little reflection to get this done but didn't
          have enough time to show us how. Also the example we used, exercise,
          is not the best because it really only has one field to modify. The
          HTTP method recommended is PATCH for this kind of update.

        <h3>How to Tell Spring How to Handle Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
          Spring is really cool because it handles a lot of exceptions for us.
          However it still lacks the foresight to be able to cover every
          possible use case. In our case we actually have no way to tell the
          user of our api that we couldn't find a record easily. So why not make
          a special exception to mark when we couldn't find something.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spring boot we can create a class that will hold the logic of how
          to handle the exception.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
<span class="code-keyword">import</span> org.springframework.web.context.request.<span class="code-class">WebRequest</span>;
<span class="code-annotation">@ControllerAdvice</span>
<span class="code-keyword">public class</span> <span class="code-class">ExceptionConfiguration</span> <span class="code-keyword">extends</span> <span class="code-class">ResponseEntityExceptionHandler</span>
    <span class="code-annotation">@ExceptionHandler</span>(<span class="code-attribute">value</span>=<span class="code-class">CustomException</span>.<span class="code-keyword">class</span>)
    <span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-class">ResponseEntity</span>&lt;<span class="code-class">Object</span>&gt; <span class="code-identifier">howToHandleException</span>(
            <span class="code-class">NoSuchEntityException</span> <span class="code-identifier">ex</span>,
            <span class="code-class">WebRequest</span> <span class="code-identifier">request</span>){
                <span class="code-comment">//etc...</span>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this class you define what kind of ResponseEntity you want to
          return of what type we want to. The simplest form is to just make an
          object passing in the exception and setting the status to one of the
          predefined statuses.
