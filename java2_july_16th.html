        <p>
          We got an assignment that basically is to create a flight website. So
          we will need to create users and any user that registers with our site
          will be an admin. Most of his document he refers to users as anyone
          who is actually going to our site whether or not they are currently
          logged in. Admins are just users who are logged in. That means that
          anybody who signs up to the site will be able to create flights delete
          flights and etc... We all agreed that in a real app this would be
          hilariously bad.
        </p>
        <section id="web-app-requirements">
          <ul>
            <li>Everyone should be able to purchase a ticket on the website</li>
            <li>
              Only admins will be able to create flights to make purchases from
            </li>
            <li>
              The airports will be a predefined set of airports and does not
              need to change during the runtime of the application
            </li>
            <li>
              When signing up a user you need to have all the following: full
              name, email, street address, phone, the number of seats the are
              purchasing, and payment info
            </li>
          </ul>

          <section id="time-in-trouble">
            <h5>The Timezones</h5>
            <p>
              So for the timezone be careful because he wants the arrival and
              departure times to be in the timezone of the airport that they are
              going to travel to. So that means if you are going from Salt Lake
              City to New York you will have to have the departure time be in
              MST and the arrival should be in EST. He said that we can use any
              external libraries for helping with the date-time stuff
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="credit-cards">
            <h5>Credit Cards</h5>
            <p>
              So for credit cards we have to keep them secure so that means no
              storing the fake CSV's and only storing the last 4 digits of the
              card. Mr. Cox is very insistent that we do not use any real credit
              card information. He also told us that to validate it would be
              just making sure that it isn't expired and that its number starts
              with a 9 so it should be easy enough to work.

        <p>
          After class all we did was just pass off and work on stuff for the day
          mostly getting started on that new assignment thought so nothing
          special.
